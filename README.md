 This study attempts to leverage tobacco prevalence and reduction initiative (MPOWER) data from the World Health Organization (WHO), to determine the relationship between initiative implementation and prevalence.  This quantitative analysis employs descriptive and predictive statistics to that end.  Results indicate weak and varying positive correlations and r-squared values between MPOWER initiatives and prevalence, which runs counter to some country and region-specific perspectives.  Further, while overall MPOWER participation is increasing over time, time itself has a moderately strong positive association with participation.
